🎮 Unity & Unreal Engine Developer | AI Systems • 2D/3D Combat • Game Design

Hi! I'm Antonis Roussos, a passionate game developer from Greece with a BSc in Computer Games Development (University of Derby).  
I specialize in gameplay programming, enemy AI, skill systems, level design, and complete game architecture using Unity and Unreal Engine.

I’ve worked both solo and in teams, and I love turning ideas into immersive, interactive experiences.
