          LostInTime is a team-developed 3D zombie survival shooter built in Unity. In this open-world wave-based game, players scavenge weapons and supplies while fighting off relentless undead hordes. I was responsible for designing and implementing the zombies, AI behavior, physics, NavMesh pathfinding, environment setup, shooting system, and particle effects. The project showcases intense FPS gameplay, strategic survival mechanics, and a dynamic world brought to life through collaborative effort and focused technical design.

          The City of Arkada is a dark fantasy 2D game I developed using Unity. As my first-ever project, it was a valuable learning experience in game design, pixel art, and Unity development. I focused on building a mysterious medieval world with a distinct atmosphere. Since it was my initial attempt at game creation, I didnâ€™t upload it to GitHub, but it remains a proud milestone in my development journey.
